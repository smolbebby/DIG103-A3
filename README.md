This Repository is for Torrens University Australia, Interaction Design (DIG103-A), Assessment Three.

It consists of a responsive-page based on Assessment Two's home-page code, alongside an additional page for the line-up, consisting of 12 artists.

As per stated in the brief, the task is as following: "This assessment requires you to design and code a second webpage for the same client as
assessment 2. The content of the page will be provided, but you are required to create the
HTML and CSS to display the content in a sophisticated manner.
Mobile responsive design:
This assessment will include the requirement of the site being fluidly responsive for mobile
and tablet. This means that the site you design is required to change its layout to suit the
size of the hardware that it is displayed on. A mobile version of the site will have a different
structural layout. For example: Two columns of text side-by-side for desktop or tablet are
responsively designed to stack on top of each other for mobile."

Marks Received for Assessment Two: HD // 100

Comments on Assessment Two: _“Super well done Leonora! 👏👏👏”_

I am very proud of this project, and will eventually re-create it from scratch using the same design starting bases and code frameworks to strengthen my skills.
